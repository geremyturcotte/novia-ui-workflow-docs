## Workflow Architecture

### Five-Phase Model

```
Phase 1: RESEARCH (Parallel)
  ├─ Market Research Agent
  ├─ User Persona Agent
  └─ Competitor Analysis Agent

Phase 2: CONCEPTUALIZATION (Sequential)
  ├─ Creative Director Agent
  ├─ Prompt Engineer Agent
  └─ Design System Architect Agent

Phase 3: GENERATION (Parallel + Auto-Scaling)
  ├─ Image Generation Executor (2-10 replicas)
  └─ Quality Validator Agent

Phase 4: REFINEMENT (Feedback Loops)
  ├─ Art Director Agent
  └─ Consensus Builder Agent

MONITORING: Real-time dashboards, alerts, feedback
```
